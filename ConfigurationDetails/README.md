## Recording parameters
- Activity table uses HH:MM:SS to elaborate ON/OFF cycle used in Audiomoth.

We used Audiomoth v1.2.0 for all recordings.

The main settings are:
- Sampling rate: 250kHz (384kHz were used for our June recordings)
- Gain: medium
- Filter: none
- Amplitude threshold: none
- Recording ON/OFF cycle: 1795 sec ON and 5 sec OFF (total 1800 sec, or 30 mins for each recording file)
	- Example (cycle duration 30 mins):
		Cycle # | Recording ON | Recording OFF
		--------|--------------|--------------
		1 | 00:00:00-00:29:55 | 00:29:55-00:30:00
		2 | 00:30:00-00:59:55 | 00:59:55-01:00:00
		3 | 01:00:00-01:29:55 | 01:29:55-01:30:00
- Daily recording period: 00:00:00-24:00:00
